Whatever microcontroller you choose, you will need to solder some wires to the logic board of your Mega Drive/Genesis. Solder points are the same as the D4s/Seb mod and they depend on the particular revision of the logic board. So open up your console, look at what is printed on the logic board and choose your model below:

* [[IC BD M5 PAL|Installation on IC BD M5 PAL]]
* [[IC BD M5 PAL VA4|Installation on IC BD M5 PAL VA4]]
* [[Mega Drive 2|Installation on Mega Drive 2]]

If your model is not listed, please open an issue providing high resolution photos of both sides of your logic board, and we will try to help.

You will also need to cut some tracks, so keep a sharp cutter handy.
