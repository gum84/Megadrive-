A few notes about the Reset Button/Orange point:
* You need to lift both legs from the PCB.
* Actually, you are recommended to desolder the whole reset button, lift the bottom legs and resolder the top legs.
* You only need to solder one of the bottom legs to the chip. Any one will do, choose the one that better fits your intended wire routing scheme.
* Before resoldering, apply some heat shrinking tube (or insulation tape) to the lifted legs, to ensure that they won't touch the PCB anymore.
