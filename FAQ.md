1. Will all games allow switching video mode during play?  

  No, some games will crash, hang or lose sync if you do that. For instance, _Sonic_ is pretty forgiving, while _Streets of Rage 3_ is definitely not. Try to set the desired mode as soon as the game starts, and please report problematic games so that we can build a list.

2. How does the Mega Drive/Genesis controller protocol work?
