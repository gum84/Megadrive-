1. Will all games allow switching video mode during play?
   No, some games will crash or hang if you do that. For instance, _Sonic_ is pretty forgiving, while _Streets of Rage 3_ is definitely not. Try to set the desired mode as soon as the game starts, and please report problematic games so that we can build a list.
